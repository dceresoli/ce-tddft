Build instructions:
===================
1) Configure and compile Quantum-Espresso in the usual way. Supported
   version are '5.0.2' and the current SVN version.

2) Download from SVN. You can build CE-TDDFT outside the Quantum-Espresso folder.
   svn checkout http://ce-tddft.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ce-tddft

3) Build CE-TDDFT:
   cd ce-tddft
   ./configure --with-qe-source=<quantum espresso folder containing make.sys>
   (for example: ./configure --with-qe-source=$HOME/Codes/espresso-5.0.2)
   make

4) CE-TDDFT will be built according to the options and libraries specified
   in make.sys and the gipaw.x executable will be places in the bin folder.


Quick start guide:
==================
To calculate NMR/EPR parameters you need:

1) pseudopotentials containing the GIPAW reconstruction (look into folder pseudo)

2) run pw.x to perform the SCF calculation

3) run gipaw.x to calculate parameters (look into folder examples for
   NMR shielding, EFG, EPR g-tensor and hyperfine couplings)


TODO:
=====
- NL-terms in circular dichroism
- restart/checkpointing
- in-memory evolution for molecules
- projection over AO's
- integrators: taylor-n, cranck-nichoson-2
- spin-orbit
- periodic crystals
