Build instructions:
===================
1) Configure and compile Quantum-Espresso in the usual way. Supported
   version are '5.0.2' and the current SVN version.

2) Download from SVN. You can build CE-TDDFT outside the Quantum-Espresso folder.
   svn checkout http://ce-tddft.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ce-tddft

3) Build CE-TDDFT:
   cd ce-tddft
   ./configure --with-qe-source=<quantum espresso folder containing make.sys>
   (for example: ./configure --with-qe-source=$HOME/Codes/espresso-5.0.2)
   make

4) CE-TDDFT will be built according to the options and libraries specified
   in make.sys and the tddft.x executable will be places in the bin folder.
